Quick TODO list for OpenVPN 3 Linux client
==========================================

This list is not an exhaustive list, but some critical points needed to be
taken care of.

- [ ] Improve logging service
  Figure out how to tackle logging in a better way than just running
  the ``openvpn3-service-logger`` utility.  Logging to file, syslog, journal
  need to be considered.

- [ ] Handle DNS configuration
  Figure out how to provide DNS server settings to NetworkManager,
  systemd-networkd and with a fallback feature.  This should probably
  be implemented as a separate OpenVPN 3 D-Bus service which the
  openvpn3-service-client process can feed with information

- [ ] Implement critical options now missing in OpenVPN 3
    - [ ] ``--fragment``
    - [ ] ``--chroot`` - allow the openvpn3-service-client process to
      chroot into a specific directory.
    - [ ] ``--user`` and ``--group`` - Transport these user/group values
      to the openvpn3-service-client process and drop privileges
      as early as possible.  Use Linux capabilities to remain the
      NET_ADMIN capapbility to be allowed to modify network config
      only.
    - [ ] ...

- [x] Rewrite argument parser in ``openvpn3``
  Make it more similar to the "git" approach.

- [ ] Implement Access Control List management in ``openvpn3`` for
  configuration and session objects

- [x] Implement listing of configuration available in the configuration manager

- [x] Implement listing of available sessions in the session manager

- [ ] Implment persistent storage of VPN profiles

- [x] Provide a possibility to restrict  end-users from retrieving VPN
  configuration profiles, only allow the openvpn3-service-client process
  to access that information.  End-users should be able to get some core
  identification variables, just not the complete configuration.

- [ ] Write a new NetworkManager plug-in for OpenVPN 3, which should essentially
  just be a D-Bus client interacting with the configuration and session
  managers.

- [ ] Write a GUI tool which can run in the background and can pop-up
  appropriate dialogue boxes whenever the front-end user needs to provide
  user credentials.

- [ ] Implement PKCS#11 support

- [ ] Integrate network configuration in OpenVPN 3 Core library to make use
  of NetworkManager, systemd-networkd or the kernel netlink API instead
  of running iproute2/net-tools.  Can be an extension of the service
  mentioned with DNS configuration.

- [ ] Look into SELinux policies, with the goal that all backend services should
  run with restricted possibilities and their own process context types.
