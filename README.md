OpenVPN 3 Linux client
======================

This is the next generation OpenVPN client for Linux.  This code is very
different from the more classic OpenVPN 2.x versions.

This client depends on D-Bus to function.  The implementation tries to resolve
a lot of issues related to privilege separation and that the VPN tunnel can
still access information needed by the front-end user which starts a tunnel.

All of the backend services will normally start automatically.  And when they
are running idle for a little while with no data to maintain, they should
also stop automatically.

The default configuration for the services assumes a service account
`openvpn` to be present. If it does not exist you should add one, e.g. by:

    # groupadd -r openvpn
    # useradd -r -s /bin/nologin -g openvpn openvpn

You will probably also need to reload D-Bus configuration to make
D-Bus aware of the newly installed service:

    # systemctl reload dbus

There are five services which is good to beware of:

* openvpn3-service-configmgr

  This is the configuration manager.  All configurations will be uploaded to
  this service before a tunnel is started.  This process is started as the
  openvpn user.

* openvpn3-service-sessionmgr

  This manages all VPN tunnels which is about to start or has started.  It
  takes care of communicating with the backend tunnel processes and ensures
  only users with the right access levels can manage the various tunnels.
  This service is started as the openvpn user.

* openvpn3-service-backend

  This is more or less a helper service.  This gets started with root
  privileges, and only the session manager is by default allowed to use
  this service.  The only task this service has is to start a new VPN
  client backend processes (the tunnel instances)

* openvpn3-service-client

  This is to be started by the openvpn3-service-backend only.  And one such
  process is started per VPN client.  Once it has started, it registers itself
  with the session manager and the session manager provides it with the needed
  details so it can retrieve the proper configuration from the configuration
  manager.  This process will also have root privileges (currently).

* openvpn3-service-logger

  This service will listen for log events happening from all the various
  backend services.  Supports writing to the console (stdout), files or
  redirect to syslog.  This is also automatically started when needed, if
  it isn't already running.


To interact with these services, there are two tools provided:

* openvpn3

  This is a brand new command line interface which does not look like
  OpenVPN 2.x at all.  It can be used to start, stop, pause, resume tunnels
  and retrieve tunnel statistics. It can also be used as import, retrieve
  and manage configurations stored in the configuration manager and retrieve
  tunnel statistics for running tunnels.

* openvpn2

  This is a simpler interface which tries to look and behave a quite more
  like the classic OpenVPN 2.x versions.  This interface is written in
  Python.  It does only allow options which are supported by the OpenVPN 3
  Core library, plus there are a handful options which are ignored as it
  is possible to establish connections without those options active.

  When running openvpn2 with --daemon it will return a D-Bus path to the
  VPN session.  This path can be used by the openvpn3 utility to further
  manage this session.


Using openvpn3
--------------

The `openvpn3` program is the main and preferred command line user interface.

* Starting a VPN session: Single-shot approach

      $ openvpn3 session-start --config my-vpn-config.conf

  This will import the configuration and start a new session directly

* Starting a VPN session: Multi-step approach

  1. Import the configuration file:

         $ openvpn3 config-import --config my-vpn-config.conf

      This will return a configuration path.  This is needed to interact
      with thisconfiguration later on.

  2. (Optional) Display all imported configs

         $ openvpn3 configs-list

  3. Start a new VPN session

         $ openvpn3 session-start --config-path /net/openvpn/v3/configuration/d45d4263x42b8x4669xa8b2x583bcac770b2

* Listing established sessions

         $ openvpn3 sessions-list

* Getting tunnel statistics
  For already running tunnels, it is possible to extract live statistics
  of each VPN session individually

      $ openvpn3 session-stats --path /net/openvpn/v3/sessions/46fff369sd155s41e5sb97fsbb9d54738124

* Managing VPN sessions
  For running VPN sessions, you manage them using the
  `openvpn3 session-manage` command, again by providing the session path.  For
  example, to restart a connection:

      $ openvpn3 session-manage --path /net/openvpn/v3/sessions/46fff369sd155s41e5sb97fsbb9d54738124 --restart

  Other actions can be `--pause`, `--resume`, and `--disconnect`.

All the `openvpn3` operations are also described via the `--help` option.

       $ openvpn3 --help
       $ openvpn3 session-start --help


Using openvpn2
--------------

The `openvpn2` front-end is a simpler interface which tries to be somewhat
similar to the old and classic openvpn-2.x generation.  It supports most of
the options used by clients, but not everything.  This might also be a
limitation of the OpenVPN 3 Core library this openvpn3-linux client builds
on.

* Starting a VPN session:

      $ openvpn2 --config my-vpn-config.conf

If the provided configuration contains the `--daemon` option, it will
provide the session path related to this session and return to the command
line again.  From this point of, this session is now to be managed via the
`openvpn3` front-end.


Prebuilt binaries
-----------------

There exists installable packages for Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
CentOS and Scientific Linux via a Fedora Copr repository.  See this
url for more details:  https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dsommers/openvpn3/


How to build it
---------------

The following dependencies are needed:

* A C++ compiler capable of at least ``-std=c++11``.  The ``./configure``
  script will try to detect if ``-std=c++14`` is available and switch to
  that if possible, otherwise it will test for ``-std=c++11``.  If support
  for neither is found, it will fail.

* mbedTLS 2.4 or newer

  https://tls.mbed.org/

* GLib2 2.50 or newer

  http://www.gtk.org
  This dependency is due to the GDBus library, which is the D-Bus
  implementation being used.

* jsoncpp 0.10.5 or newer

  https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

* libcap-ng 0.7.5 or newer

  http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/libcap-ng

* liblz4 1.7.3 or newer

  https://lz4.github.io/lz4

* libuuid 2.23.2 or newer

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux

* Python 3.4 or newer (optional)

  If Python 3.4 or newer is found, the openvpn2 utility and an openvpn3
  Python module will be built and installed.

The oldest supported Linux distribution is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

In addition, this git repository will pull in two git submodules:


* openvpn3

  https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn3
  This is the OpenVPN 3 Core library.  This is where the core
  VPN implementation is done.

* ASIO

  https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio
  The OpenVPN 3 Core library depends on some bleeding edge features
  in ASIO, so we need to do a build against the ASIO git repository.

  This openvpn3-linux git repository will pull in the appropriate ASIO
  library as a git submodule.

First install the package dependencies needed to run the build.

#### Debian/Ubuntu:
  ``# apt-get install build-essential git pkg-config autoconf autoconf-archive libglib2.0-dev libjsoncpp-dev uuid-dev
libmbedtls-dev liblz4-dev libcap-ng-dev``

#### Fedora:
  ``# dnf install gcc-c++ git autoconf autoconf-archive automake make pkgconfig mbedtls-devel glib2-devel jsoncpp-devel libuuid-devel libcap-ng-devel``

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS / Scientific Linux
  First install the ``epel-release`` repository if that is not yet installed.  Then you can run:

  ``# yum install gcc-c++ git autoconf autoconf-archive automake make pkgconfig mbedtls-devel glib2-devel jsoncpp-devel libuuid-devel lz4-devel libcap-ng-devel``


### Preparations building from git
- Clone this git repository: ``git clone git://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn3-linux``
- Enter the ``openvpn3-linux`` directory: ``cd openvpn3-linux``
- Run: ``./bootstrap.sh``

Completing these steps will provide you with a `./configure` script.


### Building OpenVPN 3 Linux client
If you already have a `./configure` script or have retrieved an
`openvpn3-linux-*.tar.xz` tarball generated by `make dist`, the following steps
will build the client.

- Run: ``./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc``
- Run: ``make``
- Run: ``make install``

The ``--prefix`` can be changed, but beware that you will then need to add
``--datarootdir=/usr/share`` instead.  This is related to the D-Bus auto-start
feature.  The needed D-Bus service profiles will otherwise be installed in a
directory the D-Bus message service does not know of.  The same is for the
``--sysconfdir`` path.  It will install a needed OpenVPN 3 D-Bus policy into
``/etc/dbus-1/system.d/``.

With everything built and installed, it should be possible to run both the
``openvpn2`` and ``openvpn3`` command line tools - even as an unprivileged
user.


Logging
-------

Logging happens via `openvpn3-service-logger`.  If not started manually,
it will automatically be started by the backend processes needing it.  The
default in that case is to send log data to syslog.  This service can be
started manually and must run as the `openvpn` user.  If  being started as
`root`, it will automatically switch to the `openvpn` user.  See
`openvpn3-service-logger --help` for more details.  Unless `--syslog` or
`--log-file` is provided, it will log to the console (stdout).

This log service can also be managed (even though fairly few options
to tweak) via `openvpn3 log-service`.  The most important feature here is
probably to modify the log level.


General debugging
-----------------

Ensure you have done a build using `--enable-debug-options` when running
`./configure`.  This ensures the most crucial debug options are available.

Most of the backend services (`openvpn3-service-logger`,
`openvpn3-service-configmgr`, `openvpn3-service-sessionmgr` and
`openvpn3-service-backendstart`) can be run in a
console.  All with the exception of `openvpn3-service-backendstart` should
run as the `openvpn` user. `openvpn3-service-backendstart` must run as
root.  See their corresponding `--help` screen for details.  Most of these
programs can be forced to provide more log data by setting `--log-level`.
And they can all provide logging to the console.

Since several of these services will also shutdown automatically when not
being in use, it can also be good to disable this mechanism by providing
`--idle-exit 0`.

The last and more tricky service is the `openvpn3-service-client` which
must be started via `openvpn3-service-backendstart`.  But it is possible
to run this client process via a debugging tool, by using the `--run-via`
and `--debugger-arg` options.

For more detailed debugging details , please see
[doxygen/debugging.md](doxygen/debugging.md)


D-Bus debugging
---------
To debug what is happening, ``busctl``, ``gdbus`` and ``dbus-send`` utilities are useful.
The service destinations these tools need to move forward are:

- net.openvpn.v3.configuration (Configuration manager)
- net.openvpn.v3.sessions (Session manager)

Both of these services allows introspection.

There exists also a net.openvpn.v3.backends service, but that is restricted
to be accessible only by the openpn user - and even that users access is
locked-down by default and introspection is not possible without modifying
the D-Bus policy.

Looking at the D-Bus log messages can be also helpful, for example with:

    $ journalctl --since today -u dbus

Further tools in the source tree which can be helpful:

- src/tests/dbus/signal-listener
  There are typically four different signals these OpenVPN 3 services sends,
  Log, StatusChange, AttentionRequired and ProcessChange.  It will dump all
  signals it receives by default, but the first command line argument you
  can provide is used to subscribe only to a specific signal name.


Contribution
------------

* Code contributions
  Code contributions are most welcome.  Please submit patches for review
  to the openvpn-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.  All patches must
  carry a Signed-off-by line and must be reviewed publicly before acceptance.
  Pull requests are not acceptable unless it is for early reviews and patch
  discussions.  Final patches *MUST* go to the mailing list.

* Testing
  This code is new.  It will be buggy.  And it needs a lot of testing.
  Please reach out on FreeNode @ #openvpn for help and discussing issues
  you encounter.

* Packagers
  We are beginning to targeting packaging in Linux distributions.  The
  Fedora Copr repository is one which is currently available.  We are
  looking for people willing to package this in other Linux distributions
  as well.



DISCLAIMER
----------

This is NOT production ready yet.  But we are getting there!  It is fully
functional and quite stable when running.  And we are getting closer to
a real beta release.  This code has also not been through the same scrutiny
by security researches as OpenVPN 2.


The OpenVPN 3 Core library is also used by the OpenVPN Connect and
PrivateTunnel clients, so the pure VPN tunnel implementation should be fairly
safe and good to use.  However, the Linux implementation with the D-Bus
integration is brand new code.
