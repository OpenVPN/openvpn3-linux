SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-configmgr`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-configmgr`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
The ``openvpn3-service-configmgr`` is a backend service for OpenVPN 3 Linux,
responsible for managing OpenVPN configuration profiles.  Once a configuration
profile has been imported, either via ``openvpn3 config-import``,
``openvpn3 session-start`` or ``openvpn2``\(1), it will run in the background as a
D-Bus service as long as it has at least one configuration profile in memory.

The VPN backend process (``openvpn3-service-client``) will retrieve the contents
of the VPN configuration profile from the configuration manager when
initializing and preparing to connect.

Only one configuration manager process can run on the system.

Configuration profiles are managed via the ``openvpn3 config-manage`` and
``openvpn3 config-acl`` commands and  new VPN sessions are started using
the ``openvpn3 session-start`` command.

This service is normally started automatically when needed, via the
*net.openvpn.v3.configmgr.service* auto-start configuration by the
``dbus-daemon``\(1), but can also be started manually on the command line.  This
process should run as the *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* user and will automatically switch to this
user account if it has the needed privileges to do so.  Beware that changing
this to another user account also requires updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version       Prints the version of the program and exists

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by
                this service.  The default is :code:`4`.  Valid values are
                :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  Higher log levels results in more
                verbose logs and log level :code:`6` will contain all debug
                log events.

--log-file LOG_DESTINATION
                By default, logging will go via the ``openvpn3-service-logger``
                service.  By providing this argument, logging will also be sent
                to *LOG_DESTINATION*, which can be either a filename or
                :code:`stdout:` where the latter one sends log data to the
                console.

--colour
                This will add colours to log events when logging to file
                or terminal.  Log events will be coloured based on the log
                level of the event.

--signal-broadcast
                Normally, the ``openvpn3-service-configmgr`` will attach a
                log stream to the ``openvpn3-service-logger`` service.  By
                providing this option, it will instead broadcast all log events
                to all listeners on the system.  This is more useful for
                debugging when the standard logging does not provide any clues.
                This is not recommended for production.

--idle-exit MINUTES
                The ``openvpn3-service-configmgr`` service will exit
                automatically if it is being idle for *MINUTES* minutes.  By
                being idle, it means no configuration profiles are being managed
                by this service.  This can be validated by running
                ``openvpn3 configs-list``.  If this results in an empty list,
                no configuration profiles are being managed.

--state-dir DIRECTORY
                Sets the directory the configuration manager must use for
                storing persistent configuration profiles.  When this argument
                is given, the service will scan this directory for configuration
                profiles and load them automatically at start-up.  Default
                directory is :code:`@OPENVPN_STATEDIR@/configs`
