:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux


DESCRIPTION
===========
OpenVPN 3 Linux is an OpenVPN platform which builds on capabilities available
on newer Linux distributions.  Compared to the more classic OpenVPN 2.x
generation, OpenVPN 3 Linux covers many more aspects of the VPN configuration
and session life-cycle.

To quickly compare them, OpenVPN 2.x is a single process which is responsible
for a single VPN session.  There are no configuration or session management
in OpenVPN 2.x itself, it depends on the systemd openvpn-client@.service and
openvpn-server@.service unit files, the Network Manager OpenVPN plug-in or
other third-party management tools.

OpenVPN 3 Linux provides full configuration and session management in addition
to the VPN tunnel itself.  For example, it has built in privilege separation
and execution models, for improved process security.  This allows unprivileged
users to start their own VPN sessions and manage them themselves.  VPN
configuration files can be shared with other users on the system or kept
private.

Through this privilege separation model, network configuration aspect of
the VPN tunnel is split out into its own process which runs with as few
privileges as possible.  In practice that means it can only to network
configuration changes.  This network configuration service is also capable
of setting up the DNS resolver out-of-the-box.  For OpenVPN 2.x to do that,
it would need to run additional scripts or use specific plug-ins to trigger
such updates on the system.

With this architecture, OpenVPN 3 Linux is split up into several services
running independently of each other.  These services are referred to as
*backend services*.  The interaction with these services happens through
what is referred to as a *user front-end*.


USER FRONT-ENDS
===============

There are several user front-ends tools which is used to interact with the
various components of OpenVPN 3 Linux.

* ``openvpn2``

  This aims to be fairly similar to the more classic ``openvpn``\(8)
  command line, with the exception that it only processes client related
  options.

* ``openvpn3``

  This is the main utility for managing all the features available in
  OpenVPN 3 Linux and has a different user interface than ``openvpn2``\(1)
  or ``openvpn``\(8).  On systems with the bash-completion integration
  installed, almost every command, option and argument used by
  ``openvpn3`` will get auto-completion help.

* ``openvpn3-admin``

  This utility is mostly targeting system administrators and provides
  interfaces to do some management of the various OpenVPN 3 D-Bus
  services.  See ``openvpn3-admin``\(8) for more details.

* ``openvpn3-session@.service`` (``openvpn3-systemd``)

  VPN sessions can be started and managed directly via ``systemctl``\(1)
  by using the ``openvpn3-session@.service`` service unit.  This also
  enables VPN sessions to be started automatically during system boot.
  This service unit uses a helper utility, ``openvpn3-systemd``\(1)
  which works as a glue layer between the OpenVPN 3 Linux services and
  ``systemd``

In addition, a Python 3 module is also available making it possible to write
your own OpenVPN 3 front-ends with little extra efforts.  Both ``openvpn2``
and ``openvpn3-systemd`` are Python 3 scripts which makes use of this
OpenVPN 3 Python module.


OPENVPN 3 D-BUS SERVICES
========================

The front-end interfaces talks to services which are started automatically
when needed and usually stops running if they are not in use.  There are
several services, where each service only is responsible for a fairly small
set of features.

* **Configuration Manager** (``openvpn3-service-configmgr``)

  This provides a service which only takes care of managing VPN
  configuration profiles for all users on the system.  It has a built in
  Access Control List mechanism, which ensures only users granted access
  can access the information they need.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.configuration*


* **Session Manager** (``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr``)

  This service takes care of managing running OpenVPN sessions on the
  system.  This has also its own set of Access Control List mechanisms,
  where users on the system can be granted access to VPN sessions
  started by other users.  The default behaviour is to only let the
  user starting a VPN session manage and access it.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.sessions*

* **VPN Client Backend** (``openvpn3-service-client``)

  This is the core VPN client.  There will be running one such process
  per active VPN session.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.backends.be${PID}*


* **VPN Backend Starter** (``openvpn3-service-backendstart``)

  This is a helper service which is used by the Session Manager to start
  a new VPN backend service.  When a client profile is requested started,
  it will start an ``openvpn3-service-client`` process per VPN session.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.backends*

* **Network Configuration** (``openvpn3-service-netcfg``)

  This is the most privileged D-Bus service, and is used by the
  Backend VPN Client processes.  This is responsible for creating and
  manage virtual network interfaces, configure IP addresses, routes in
  addition to handling the DNS setup.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.netcfg*

* **Logging** (``openvpn3-service-logger``)

  This is responsible to receive log events from all the services above
  and ensure they get logged properly.  Whether that is to a terminal, a
  log file or syslog, depends on the configuration.  The default is
  to start this service using the syslog integration.

  D-Bus name: *net.openvpn.v3.log*

All of these services above are D-Bus services which is available on the
system bus.  They are all automatically started when needed.


D-BUS POLICY
============

D-Bus enforces usage of a policy which defines who can access which D-Bus
service and which features, objects and properties provided by a D-Bus service.

The default OpenVPN 3 Linux policy is placed in several files prefixed
``net.openvpn.v3`` in ``@DBUS_SYSTEM_POLICYDIR@``.  The default policy
provided by OpenVPN 3 Linux allows all users on the system to load, start
and manage their own OpenVPN configuration profiles and VPN sessions.

All the D-Bus services will start automatically when their services are
requested by a front-end.  Each service has their own D-Bus service definition,
which can be found in ``@DBUS_SYSTEM_SERVICEDIR@/net.openvpn.v3.*.service``.

When an OpenVPN 3 Linux D-Bus service has been idle for a certain time and
it does not need to preserve any data kept in memory, it will automatically
stop running.  See the man page for each service to see default idle time.


COMPATIBILITY WITH OPENVPN 2.x
==============================

OpenVPN 3 is mostly compatible with most of the client options found in
OpenVPN 2.x.  But there are some important details where it differs.

* No TAP support

  OpenVPN 3 does not support TAP interfaces, only TUN interfaces.  This is
  by design, as all OS platforms which provides a VPN API (Apple iOS,
  macOS, Android, Microsoft Universal Windows Platform) does only support
  TUN interfaces.

* ``--fragment`` is not supported

  While the use-cases for this feature is acknowledged, it is not
  considered an easy feature to implement and it is being worked on
  alternatives which gives a reasonably equivalent user experience without
  using ``--fragment`` where this will be automatically configured.  If it
  turns out an alternative approach is impossible, this feature might be
  implemented in the end.

* Currently no PKCS#11 support

  This is a bigger task which will be worked on later, but it will attempt
  to integrate better on the overall Linux platform instead of providing
  an OpenVPN specific implementation.

These are the most obvious features users will notice.  This list might be
extended as we receive more feedback.
